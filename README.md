# Project Summary

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Business Intelligence solution built using Microsoft Power BI. It covers the complete BI workflow from transforming raw operational data into an enterprise-ready semantic model to delivering interactive executive dashboards for business reporting and decision support.

The project is divided into two phases:

- **Phase 1:** Design and development of a scalable Power BI semantic model using dimensional modeling, Galaxy Schema, DAX, Power Query, and Row-Level Security (RLS).
- **Phase 2:** Development of six interactive executive dashboards built on the semantic model to deliver business insights across sales, products, customers, inventory, campaigns, and order operations.

The final solution transforms **23 raw operational tables** into a centralized Business Intelligence model consisting of **6 Dimension tables, 6 Fact tables, 2 Support tables, reusable DAX measures, and 6 executive dashboards**, following enterprise BI best practices.

```
                Dimensions
                     │
     ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
     │               │               │
Customer        Product        Geography
     │               │               │
     └──────┬────────┴────────┬──────┘
            │                 │

- Build normalized Fact tables.
- Improve data quality.
- Protect business metrics during transformations.
- Create reusable DAX measures.
- Implement Row-Level Security.

---

#  Workflow

## Step 1 - Business Understanding

Before transforming data:

- Explored all 23 source tables.
- Understood the business processes.
- Identified entities.
- Classified tables into Facts and Dimensions.
- Determined the grain of every table.

Questions answered:

- What does this table represent?
- Is it transactional or descriptive?
- Should it become a Fact or Dimension?
- What does one row represent?

---

## Step 2 - Define Modeling Standards

Established project standards before development.

Implemented:

- Star Schema design
- snake_case naming convention
- Table prefixes (`fact_`, `dim_`)
- Surrogate key naming (`*_key`)
- Business-friendly column names
- Standardized date formatting

---

## Step 3 - Organize Power Query

Created four development folders.

```
Stage
Dimensions
Facts
Support
```

Purpose:

- Better organization
- Easier maintenance
- Cleaner ETL process

---

## Step 4 - Explore Raw Data

Reviewed every source table individually.

Tables analyzed included:

- Customers
- Products
- Orders
- Inventory
- Campaigns
- Payments
- Shipments
- Cities
- Regions
- Sales Targets
- Security
- User Details
- Addresses
- Invoice Data

For each table:

- Identified business purpose.
- Determined grain.
- Checked data quality.
- Planned relationships.

---

## Step 5 - Build Dimension Tables

### Customer Dimension

Merged:

- Customer Master
- Customer Contacts
- User Details
- Addresses
- Cities

Performed:

- Removed dummy records.
- Resolved duplicate customers.
- Merged customer information.
- Removed technical IDs.
- Applied naming standards.
- Created `dim_customer`.

---

### Product Dimension

Merged:

- Products
- Subcategories

Performed:

- Removed duplicate products.
- Split category hierarchy.
- Standardized text.
- Created Product Key.
- Removed unnecessary columns.
- Created `dim_product`.

---

## Step 6 - Transition to Fact Modeling

Used a business-process approach.

Workflow:

```
Business Process

↓

Extract Dimensions

↓

Build Fact

↓

Repeat
```

This reduced complexity while maintaining business context.

---

## Step 7 - Analyze Order Process

Analyzed:

- Orders 2025
- Orders 2026
- Order Line Items

Learned the Header vs Detail pattern.

### Header

One row = One Order

Contains:

- Customer
- Address
- Status
- Order Date

### Detail

One row = One Product within an Order

Contains:

- Product
- Quantity
- Sales
- Cost

Selected the Detail table as the Fact because it represents the lowest grain.

---

## Step 8 - Build Fact Sales

Created `fact_sales` using Order Line Items.

Performed:

- Appended yearly order tables.
- Removed unused columns.
- Merged order information.
- Added Customer Key.
- Added Product Key.
- Added Order Flag Key.
- Added Geography Keys.
- Removed descriptive columns.
- Retained only keys, dates, and measures.

---

## Step 9 - Create Junk Dimension

Created:

```
dim_order_flags
```

Instead of separate dimensions for:

- Order Status
- Priority
- Channel

Stored unique combinations with a surrogate key.

---

## Step 10 - Data Enrichment

Mapped business codes to meaningful values.

Example:

```
10 → Online Store

20 → Retail Partner

30 → Wholesale

40 → Field Sales
```

Improved readability for reporting.

---

## Step 11 - Data Validation

Validated business numbers after every major transformation.

Validation process:

```
Merge

↓

Refresh

↓

Compare Total Sales

↓

Continue only if numbers remain unchanged
```

Detected and fixed:

- Duplicate products
- Incorrect joins
- Inflated totals

---

## Step 12 - Build Geography Dimension

Created:

```
dim_geo
```

Performed:

- Created Geography Key.
- Replaced Ship-To City with key.
- Replaced Bill-To City with key.

Implemented a Role Playing Dimension.

---

## Step 13 - Build Star Schema

Connected all Dimensions to Facts.

Implemented:

- One-to-Many relationships
- Single-direction filtering
- Shared Dimensions

Avoided:

- Fact-to-Fact joins
- Bidirectional filtering
- Circular dependencies

---

## Step 14 - Build Inventory Fact

Original data:

```
Product

Jan

Feb

Mar

Apr
```

Applied:

- Unpivot transformation
- Product lookup
- Product Key
- Removed descriptive fields

Created a normalized inventory fact.

---

## Step 15 - Build Campaign Model

Separated campaign data into:

### Dimension

```
dim_campaign
```

Contains:

- Campaign Name
- Channel
- Budget
- Start Date
- End Date

### Fact

```
fact_campaign_spend
```

Contains:

- Daily Spend
- Clicks
- Impressions

---

## Step 16 - Build Factless Fact

Created:

```
fact_promotion_coverage
```

Contains:

- Campaign Key
- Product Key

No numeric measures.

Used to analyze campaign coverage.

---

## Step 17 - Build Order Process Fact

Modeled the complete order lifecycle.

Business flow:

```
Order

↓

Shipment

↓

Delivery

↓

Invoice

↓

Payment
```

Created an Accumulating Snapshot Fact for process analysis.

Calculated:

- Order to Payment Duration

---

## Step 18 - Standardize the Semantic Model

Performed:

- Standardized date formats.
- Standardized column formatting.
- Removed automatic aggregation from IDs and Keys.
- Applied consistent naming conventions.

---

## Step 19 - Build Date Dimension

Created:

```DAX
dim_date = CALENDARAUTO()
```

Added:

- Year
- Month
- Day

Connected the Date Dimension to multiple Fact tables.

Enabled consistent time-based analysis.

---

## Step 20 - Create Reusable Business Measures

Created a dedicated table:

```
_measures
```

Implemented reusable DAX measures including:

- Total Sales
- Total Orders
- Active Customers
- Total Customers
- Average Order to Payment Days

Purpose:

- Centralized KPI definitions.
- Reduced duplicate calculations.
- Ensured consistent business metrics.

---

## Step 21 - Implement Row-Level Security

Configured security using:

- Security table
- User Email
- Region

Implemented:

- One-to-Many relationship
- USERPRINCIPALNAME()
- Dynamic region-based filtering

Validated access using multiple user accounts.

---

## Step 22 - Final Validation

Performed a complete review of the semantic model.

Verified:

- Star Schema integrity
- Relationship cardinality
- Filter directions
- Data quality
- Business totals
- Naming standards
- Date formatting
- Aggregation behavior
- Security configuration
